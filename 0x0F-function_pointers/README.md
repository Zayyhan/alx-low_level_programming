0x0F. C - Function pointers

Task 0
Write a function that prints a name.

Task 1
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
where size is the size of the array
and action is a pointer to the function you need to use

Task 2
Write a function that searches for an integer.
where size is the number of elements in the array array
cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
If no element matches, return -1
If size <= 0, return -1ff

Task 3
Write a program that performs simple operations.



You are allowed to use the standard library

Usage: calc num1 operator num2

You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int

operator is one of the following:

+: addition

-: subtraction

*: multiplication

/: division

%: modulo

The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line

You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int

if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98

if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99

if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100

This task requires that you create four different files.



3-calc.h



This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. You can use this structure:

3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.



Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);

where s is the operator passed as argument to the program

This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add

You are not allowed to use switch statements

You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops

You are not allowed to use goto

You are not allowed to use else

You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code

You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code

If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL

You are only allowed to declare these two variables in this function:

3-main.c



This file should contain your main function only.



You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file

You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function

You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int

You are not allowed to use any kind of loop

You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements
